# Why?

At ThreatNG, we built a product around open source intelligence (OSINT), which compromises technical and non-technical aspects, something that separates us from others in our competitive landscape. As we continue building new, innovative solutions to modern-day risks and threats, we decided that some of our plans were better shared with the broader community to help drive even more security, privacy, and risk innovation.
